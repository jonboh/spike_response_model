# Spike Response Model
The SRM is a deterministic model of Spiking Neurons. Specifically a "Hard-Threshold Adaptive Integrate and Fire Model".

If you want to learn more about the theoretical foundations of this code go to:

All equations have been taken from there.

Warning: I'm not a neuroscientist, so you might wanna keep a good dose of skepticism about the correctness of the resulting simulations.

Corrections and recommendations of any kind are welcomed.
