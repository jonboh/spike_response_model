# Spike Response Model
The SRM is a deterministic model of Spiking Neurons. Specifically a "Hard-Threshold Adaptive Integrate and Fire Model".

All equations have been taken from there.


Warning: I'm not a neuroscientist, so you might wanna keep a good dose of skepticism about the correctness of the resulting simulations.
